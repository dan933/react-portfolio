# Portfolio website

This site was created using React and material UI
Google forms is integrated into the html contact form.

AWS Sam is used to for the backend please see https://github.com/dan933/dan-albert-portfolio-back-end for details.

Packages such as react-animation-on-scroll where used for the scroll animations

I'm looking to add more projects and live demo's in the future.
The projects have a demo login for people that want to try the app without signing up.
